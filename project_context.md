This is the Website for vibe jam

It is written in php, html, css. No frameworks. This website needs to be mobile responsive.

It needs space to show all the submissions for vibe jam. There are already about 500 and there might be near 1000 submissions at the end so it'd be nice if we can add them all with a screenshot.

Vibe Jam is a competition for vibe coded in browser video games.
